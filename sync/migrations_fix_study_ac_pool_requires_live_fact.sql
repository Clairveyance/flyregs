-- 2026-08-15. RC, real device, Study Mode card reading only "Fractional
-- Ownership Programs" / "Tap to reveal": "this is an example of a
-- non-sensical question... it's not even a question... i spent a bunch of
-- money to get things read and understood in a way that would allow better
-- Q/A making, and we're still getting stuff like this. frustrating. fix it."
--
-- Root cause: get_study_queue()'s fresh_ac CTE selects every active AC with
-- a non-empty `description` into the "new card" pool, with NO check for
-- whether a real study_facts row exists. When one doesn't, the client falls
-- through to buildStudyCard()'s AC template (quizQuestion.ts's own comment:
-- "Start simple... Q is the AC's OWN title VERBATIM... comes later" -- a
-- deliberate 2026-07-31 placeholder, never meant to be the permanent shape).
--
-- The $72 question-bank pass (author_question_bank.py, pdf_text-sourced,
-- 2026-08-12) DID genuinely run and covers 776 of 779 active ACs with real
-- content-derived facts -- confirmed live, not the description-only
-- author_fact_deck.py path. But 3 ACs were never picked up by any pass
-- (91-84 Fractional Ownership Programs, 90-91K North American Route
-- Program, 8260-32F USAF TERPS Service) and still fall into the pool,
-- which is exactly what RC hit. This wasn't a one-off -- any future AC
-- added to the corpus before its own authoring pass runs would hit the
-- same gap, since the pool never checked for it.
--
-- Fix: fresh_ac now requires a live study_facts row, same shape as the
-- knowledge-level/category exclusions already in this function. FAR/AIM
-- are NOT touched -- their buildStudyCard() fallbacks are real, deliberately
-- built question templates (verbatim question-shaped titles, "Which Part X
-- rule covers Y?"), not a bare-title placeholder; only AC's fallback was
-- ever meant to be temporary. This permanently closes the gap rather than
-- just patching today's 3 stragglers -- coverage evolves, this check
-- doesn't need to be revisited each time it does.
